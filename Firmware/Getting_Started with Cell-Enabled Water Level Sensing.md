# Getting Started with Cell-Enabled Water Level Sensing
## Particle and Visual Studio
This section will help you set up Visual Studio Code and Particle Workbench, two important platforms you'll need for the following exercises.

1. Download Visual Studio (the one with the blue icon, not purple) [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download Particle Workbench [here](https://www.particle.io/workbench/) and create an account using your email address of choice (select 'Education' for account type if applicable). Make sure you have Visual Studio installed prior to running the installer.
	- The installer says that it will install Visual Studio (VS) along with Particle, but this does not work properly and will fail if VS is not installed first.
3. Log into Particle on Visual Studio if it doesn’t automatically (this is important because you won’t be able to install necessary libraries without being logged in).

## Useful features
This section lists some commands and programming features that will be helpful in the following exercises.

1. Open the Particle Command Palette: Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows; or Command+Shift+P on Mac; or select the 'view' tab -> Command Palette; or click the 'Launch Command Palette' button on the 'welcome' tab).
2. In the top right corner, there are some important symbols in white circles:
	- Compile: checkmark
	- Flash: lightning bolt
3. These symbols will be used later to compile and flash code (i.e. importing code to the Boron device).
4. Save your projects frequently using Ctrl+S on Windows or Command+S on Mac. Make sure your directories are exactly how you want them to avoid pathway issues in your coding projects!
5. Keep this in your back pocket, but don't use it yet: in cases where the Boron stops responding as expected or displaying error LED sequences, you may need to restore the device. Particle has an online, USB-based option here: [https://docs.particle.io/tools/device-restore/device-restore-usb/](https://docs.particle.io/tools/device-restore/device-restore-usb/).

## Common problems
This section lists some common problems you may encounter in the following exercises and how to address them.

Skip this section for now and try the **Practice Code with Boron** section first. Refer back to this list if you encounter problems.
1. If you receive a "No Device Found" or "Serial Time Out" message when using "Particle: Identify" ... First, double-check that you have selected Boron in the bottom right bar, have selected the correct OS version (for me, it is 4.2.0), and put the device in listening mode (by pressing and holding the Mode button until the LED blinks blue). If those settings are correct but you're still having issues, try unplugging/replugging the device or restarting VS and/or your computer.
2. If you have problems in **Practice code with Boron and Adalogger** ... If Initializing SD Card and initialization failed, check that the micro SD card is empty. Plug it into your computer, open the SD card, and delete every file on it.
3. If met with unsuccessful compiling and a message stating that your file is dirty, try accepting the offer to 'clean' your file. If this doesn't fix the issue, try closing VS, deleting the project from your computer, and starting over.
4. If every time you instal a library you recieve an error. Try logining into your particle acount. This is done by typing into the command prompt or CLI '>particle: login'. Then enter your particle username and password. After loging in, try to reinstall the libary again. 

## Practice code with Boron
This section will take you through an exercise to set up your Boron device and practice using code with it.

1. Plug in the Boron device to your computer using a micro-USB cable. Visit [https://docs.particle.io/tools/device-restore/device-restore-usb/](https://docs.particle.io/tools/device-restore/device-restore-usb/) and click 'Select Device.' Restore to the default system firmware version matching the example (not 'custom user firmware') and set the current compiled [target](SLR_Boron_Maxbotix_MB7092_cm/target) to be 4.2.0 (this is the version I am using).
	- Note: If you get the message `Could not identify device: No serial port identified` but the Boron powers up, ensure that your cable has data transfer capabilities (many are only capable of charging). Or, if no device is found using the device restore page, Put the Boron into DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode by pressing and holding the 'Mode' button on the Boron while simultaneously pressing and releasing the 'Reset' button.
2. Create a folder on your computer to store Particle-related items (no spaces in the title; use underscores (_) ... something like Particle_Items).
3. Create a new project by opening the Particle Command Palette (see: 'Useful features') and selecting 'Particle: Create New Project.' You can also click the blue text that says 'Create New Project' on the welcome page under Development Workflow -> Code.
4. Choose the folder you just made on your computer for this class when asked to choose the 'parent' folder.
5. Once you have the directory in which you want to store your Particle projects, create a project name (no spaces) ... Something like Blink_LED.
6. Copy the code from the file named `Blink_LED.cpp` (not the one you just made but from the example [here](https://github.com/SUPScientist/Smart-Coasts/blob/main/Class-01-Intro/Blink_LED.cpp)).
7. Navigate to the .cpp file that is generated for your new project under the 'src' tab on the left-hand side of screen (under 'explorer').
8. Delete all the text in the .cpp file after line 10 and paste the code you just copied.
	- Note: Make sure you leave lines 9-10 (seen below), as your .cpp file will not run properly without line 10. <br />
`// Include Particle Device OS APIs` <br />
`#include "Particle.h"`
	- Optional: Fill in lines 2-4 of the .cpp file (i.e. project name, author name, date); this info is for organizational purposes and will not affect your code if you leave it blank.

<img src="Photos/Blink_LED_Header.jpg" width="500">

9. Open the Command Palette. Type 'Particle' and select 'Particle Launch CLI.'
10. Configure Workbench to work with the Device OS that you confirmed you're using in the beginning of this section. Your settings should be across the bottom of the page; make sure the first setting says 'Boron' and the second says "deviceOS@[4.2.0 or your specific number]" by clicking and changing them if need be.
11. Put the Boron into DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode again by pressing and holding the 'Mode' button on the Boron while simultaneously pressing and releasing the 'Reset' button. Continue holding 'Mode' until the RGB (Red Green Blue) LED starts flashing yellow.
12. Put the Boron in listening mode by pressing and holding 'Mode' until the LED blinks blue).
	- Note: You may have to press the ‘Reset’ button after putting the Boron in DFU mode and before putting it in listening mode if the LED doesn't begin blinking blue after a few seconds.
13. Type the following command into the CLI: `particle identify` ... The CLI results should present the OS with which you're working; for me, it is 4.2.0.
14. Open the Command Palette and run 'Particle: flash application (local)' to compile and flash your script (your .cpp file) to your device. If successful, this will result in the blinking of a blue LED near the micro-USB socket on the Boron.
15. Be sure to save your project before closing it.

## Practice code with Boron and Adalogger 
This section will take you through an exercise to set up the Boron and Adalogger devices and practice using code with them.

1. Stack the Boron on top of the Adalogger using female headers.

<img src="Photos/BAda_Separate.jpeg" width="150"> <img src="Photos/BAda_Stack.jpeg" width="150"> <img src="Photos/BAda_Stack2.jpeg" width="150"> <img src="Photos/BAda_Stack3.jpeg" width="150">

2. Plug in the Boron and put it in listening mode again (by pressing and holding 'Mode' until the LED blinks blue). Type `particle identify` into the CLI again and make sure 'Boron' and the correct Device OS (e.g. 4.2.0) are selected in the bottom bar.
3. Create a new project (I named mine RTCtest).
	- See 'Useful features' and 'Practice code with Boron' if you need a refresher on how to create a new project.
	- Make sure this new project is located exactly where you want it on your computer to avoid pathway issues (i.e. nesting this project under 'Particle_Items' is okay, but do NOT nest it within 'Blink_LED' as that is an unrelated project.)
4. Open the Command Palette and type 'Particle: Install Library'
5. Type in 'SdFat' and press enter to install the SdFat library.
6. A new tab titled 'lib' should now be under the 'explorer' tab for this project on the left ... open it!
7. Click on 'examples' -> 'ReadWrite' -> 'ReadWrite.ino' 
8. Copy all the code on this page.
9. Now click the tab that says 'src' on the left, then '[yourprojecttitle].cpp'
10. In the .cpp file, delete all code after line 10 and paste the new code you just copied from the 'ReadWrite.ino' file.
	- Like earlier, make sure `#include "Particle.h"` is left in the code! Otherwise, your .cpp file won't work properly.
 	- You have the option again to fill in applicable information in lines 2-4.

<img src="Photos/RTC_Header.jpg" width="500">

12. In line 36, change `#define SD_CS_PIN SS` to `#define SD_CS_PIN D5` (SS -> D5)
13. After `File myFile;` create a new line and paste
`SYSTEM_MODE(SEMI_AUTOMATIC);` <br />
`SYSTEM_THREAD(ENABLED);`
14. After `void setup(){` create a new line and paste `Cellular.off();` and in the next line paste `delay(5500);` 
15. Where it says `if (!SD.begin(SD_CS_PIN,)) {` paste `if (!SD.begin(SD_CS_PIN,SPI_FULL_SPEED)) {`

This image shows what your code should look like after you make the changes from steps 12-15.

<img src="Photos/RTC_Code.jpg" width="500">

16. Click the checkmark to compile the project (will take a minute).
	- If you are met with errors when trying to compile, make sure you have the correct device and OS selected in the bottom banner, check that all steps were completed correctly, and/or refer back to **Common Problems**.
17. Once it compiles, click the lightning bolt button to flash the code to the Boron. 
	- Boron should flash yellow/green when being put into DFU mode, then should breathe a white/blue light once it’s flashed.
	- Should also say it flashed successfully ... unplugging and re-plugging the cord into Boron can sometimes help if it doesn’t flash.
18. Open the serial monitor: Command Palette -> 'Particle: Serial Monitor'
 	- Select 'yes' if prompted whether you want to 'automatically reconnect when port is closed'
20. If the Adalogger does not work, the serial monitor may read something like the first chunk of text below. If it does work, it should read like the second chunk of text.

**NEED TO UPDATE PHOTOS - I DO NOT HAVE THEM**

22. If you encounter problems, go to **Common Problems** and double check that you did each step correctly. You can also try pressing the 'Reset' button on the Boron, or unplugging and re-plugging the cord.
23. Be sure to save your project before closing it.

## Practice water level sensor full code (Boron and Adalogger) 
This section will allow you to practice using water level sensor code and working with the Boron and Adalogger devices.

1. For ease of acces when flashing code to the Boron, we recommend taking the entire printed circuit board out of the SK-15 enclosure. Unscrew the four screws surronding the circuit and take it out of the enclosure. The power cord doesn't need to be plugged in as the micro USB connection from your computer will provide enough power. If possible keep the ultra rangfinder sensor plugged into the printed circuit board. Once you have the printed circuit board out (with Boron, addalonger... connected to it), procced to plug in micro-USB cable from your computer to the Boron.
2. 1. Plug in the Boron device to your computer using a micro-USB cable. Visit [https://docs.particle.io/tools/device-restore/device-restore-usb/](https://docs.particle.io/tools/device-restore/device-restore-usb/) and click 'Select Device.' Restore to the default system firmware version matching the example (not 'custom user firmware') and set the current compiled [target](SLR_Boron_Maxbotix_MB7092_cm/target) to be 6.1.0 (this is the version I am using).
	- Note: If you get the message `Could not identify device: No serial port identified` but the Boron powers up, ensure that your cable has data transfer capabilities (many are only capable of charging). Or, if no device is found using the device restore page, Put the Boron into DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode by pressing and holding the 'Mode' button on the Boron while simultaneously pressing and releasing the 'Reset' button.
3. Create a folder on your computer to store Particle-related items (no spaces in the title; use underscores (_) ... something like Particle_Items).
4. Create a new project by opening the Particle Command Palette (see: 'Useful features') and selecting 'Particle: Create New Project.' You can also click the blue text that says 'Create New Project' on the welcome page under Development Workflow -> Code.
5. Choose the folder you just made on your computer for this class when asked to choose the 'parent' folder.
6. Once you have the directory in which you want to store your Particle projects, create a project name (no spaces) ... something like Water_Level_Boron

7. On this GitHub repository, go to 'Firmware' -> 'SLR_Boron_Maxbotix_MB7092_cm' -> 'src' -> 'SLR_Boron_Maxbotix_MB7092_cm.cpp' (or follow [this link](https://github.com/COAST-Lab/Open-Water-Level/blob/main/Firmware/SLR_Boron_Maxbotix_MB7092_cm/src/SLR_Boron_Maxbotix_MB7092_cm.cpp)).
8. Copy all the code on this page after line 13 (i.e. lines 14 onward).
9. In Particle Workbench, create a new project (I named mine BAdaFull).
	- See 'Useful features' and 'Practice code with Boron' if you need a refresher on how to create a new project.
	- Optionally, you can fill in the header with your info (i.e. project, your name, date)

10. Open the Command Palette and type 'Particle: Install Library' 
11. Type in 'SdFat' and press enter to install the SdFat library.
12. Go to the .cpp file in the new project you created (it should have the same name as your project).
13. Delete all code after line 9 (i.e. lines 10 onward) and paste the new code you copied from GitHub (remember: must have `#include "Particle.h"`). Your new header should look like this:

<img src="Photos/BAdaFull_Header.jpeg" width="400">

14. In line 45, make sure the number after `#define PUBLISHING` is `0`.
	- If it says `1`, change it to `0`
 	- This step is crucial! It ensures that we aren't publishing data via cellular connection, which is important since we are just completing a test run.
	- Once a device is deployed with the intent of publishing data and using a cell connection, this binary value can be changed back to `1` ... but we aren't quite there yet, so make sure it says `0`!

15. At this point, I like to compile my code as a sort of "checkpoint" to make sure there aren't any issues. Click the check mark to compile.
	- If met with errors, make sure you have "Boron" and "4.2.0" selected in the page's bottom ribbon, and check that you completed each step of these instructions correctly.

16. Once your code compiles properly, flash it to the Boron by clicking the lightnight bolt. 
	- If your device is not responding or the flash is unsuccessful, make sure the device is in DFU mode, or try unplugging/replugging the cord.

17. Once flashed successfully, quickly open the serial monitor: Command Palette -> 'Particle: Serial Monitor'
18. It may take a moment, but the terminal should look something like the picture below. The serial monitor should say `serial connection closed. Attempting to reconnect…`

<img src="Photos/BAdaFull_SerialMonitor.jpeg" width="400">

If it still doesn't work, try the problem-solving methods from Step 16 again or visit 'Useful features' and 'Common problems.'

19. The numbers produced under `Serial monitor opened successfully:` represent four useful data values, listed as follows: Unix timestamp, distance measured by the sensor (cm), battery voltage (volts), battery level (%)
	- Lines 135-139 (pictured) show how these values are printed from the code.
	- Please note that Unix timestamps represent seconds since 1 Jan 1970. However, the Unix timestamps from our non-cellular trials represent seconds from 1 Jan 2000 each time the Boron is restarted. Once we use cellular connection when deploying the device, we'll have real time stamps (i.e. since 1970).
	- Please note that the battery voltage and battery level may show values of zero; these measures are related to an external rechargeable battery that we did not connect for these test trials ... Instead, we powered the device from a laptop / computer.

<img src="Photos/BAdaFull_Lines_135-139.jpeg" width="500">

20. To finish collecting data, unplug the Boron to stop the code from running.
	- Don't forget to save your project.
	- If you wish to run this test trial again and recieve data results in faster time intervals, you can change the `SECONDS_BETWEEN_MEASUREMENTS` value in line 74 from `3600` to `30`. This will take readings at 30 second intervals instead of hourly intervals. Just be sure to change this value back to `3600` when you officially deploy the device!

21. To check all the collected values, take out the SD card from the Adalogger and put it into an SD card reader to then plug into your computer.
22. Navigate to 'file explorer' -> 'this PC' -> 'USB drive' -> `distance.csv`. You should see a table with values like below!
	- On Mac, access this file via Finder -> Locations (Untitled) -> `distance.csv`

<img src="Photos/BAdaFull_csv.jpeg" width="300">

23. Unix timestamps are listed in the leftmost column, then distance (cm), then battery voltage (volts), and battery level (%) in the rightmost column.
	- If you want to save the data from the micro SD card, press ctrl+s (Windows) or command+s (Mac) to save the data file on your computer.

All done! Now, you're more familiar with powerful tools like the Boron and Adalogger devices and VS Code, and you've learned how to collect and store the distance data. Great work!
