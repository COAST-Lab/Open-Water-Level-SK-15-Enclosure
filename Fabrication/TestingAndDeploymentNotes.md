# Testing and Deployment Notes for WL_004 and WL_005


## Calculations for WL_0004 

Standard deviation of 5 values over 5 hours: 1.7073168369257 inches 

NOTES: There was human error on the last value that decreased the average by about 2 inches.  

 

## Power/Deployment Notes for WL_004:  

After testing the water level sensor measurements in the lab, I attached the solar panel on Thursday. I used marine epoxy to seal up the screws on the polycase and left the whole sensor put together in the fume hood until the day of deployment on Tuesday. This did not help with charging the battery so when we deployed WL_004 on CMS dock it had about 0.25 battery.  

Even with a low battery start the solar panel has maintained the running of WL4, however, the charge remains between 0.25 and 0.6 which is not ideal.  

Next time use an extra nut and silicon epoxy on screws that connect polycase to 3D piece.
