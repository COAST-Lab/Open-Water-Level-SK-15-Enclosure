# PVC End Caps
- End caps designed to be 3D printed and glued (PVC cement or epoxy) onto 1-1/2" Sch 40 PVC pipe
- The ultrasonic sensor is threaded into NPT threads on the bottom end cap
- The top end cap has a bracket for fastening the solar panel, plus a hole for 1.5" gripper to serve as a plug
    - `Are we still using a top end cap? Or just the red gripper instead?`
